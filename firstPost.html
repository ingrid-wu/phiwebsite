            <h2 class="section-heading">Preparation for Creation</h2>

            <p>This last week for our engineering project, Phoebe and Emily Wong completed their necessary shop trainings and have been practicing their welding skills in Davis shop. They’ve also have continued to consult with the shop leads about plans for construction. Emily Hu has been in contact with the postmasters and is still awaiting mailbox approval.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Ordering the Necessary Materials</h2>

            <p> We’ve ordered all of our main components such as our angle brackets and aluminum sheets from Jacobs Hall, hinges, bolts, a lock, and door handle from Home Depot, and sensors and Raspberry Pi from Vetco. Kento has helped make trips to Home Depot to pick up materials we needed such as rivets and chemically protective paint. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Technical Components</h2>

            <p> Ingrid has been creating and continuously updating our website with our progress. She started the website, hosted on Github Pages, and has a minimum working version. HaiTao has gotten started on the coding that will allow for Slack notifications and has done about 45% of it. The skeleton code is fully finished and he’s currently working on the details of it. This coding is being done using Python. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Fundraising</h2>

            <p>Jarek and Kevin have been in charge of fundraising for the project. They’ve put together fundraising schedules for selling Krispy Kreme in Sproul and SF and have coordinated with the ASUC for needed permits. We recently completed two rounds of fundraising, totaling around $250 of profit. Phoebe, HaiTao, Kevin, and Ingrid took a trip into San Francisco to sell Krispy Kreme for rush hour on Wednesday. The whole Phi Pledge Class tabled at Sproul on Friday. Many brothers and friends stopped by the Krispy Kreme booth to support our fundraising. Krispy Kreme will continue to be our main source for fundraising.</p>
