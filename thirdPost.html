            <p>Emily Wong and Phoebe finished cutting the last few pieces of flat, angle bar, and sheet metal. This past week, after going through a tough training program, they began welding the mailbox! First they set up the four posts that made up the main structure of the mailbox. They first welded the angle bar and flat bars together. This took roughly 2 sessions at Jacobs Hall. Following that, they attached the sheet metal to the inside of the bars. Construction of the mailbox this previous week was delayed due to worker union protests going on at UC Berkeley. However, Phoebe and Emily Wong are excited to start again next week!</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Hello World</h2>

            <p>All materials for the electronic components arrived this past week. The Phi Pledge Class had been waiting on their solar panels for two weeks and were very excited to see them finally arrive. Emily Hu, HaiTao, and Kevin presented their working prototype last Friday to the class and everyone was very surprised to see the Slack connected to the sensors. This week, the three have been calibrating and testing the current prototype and working on the addition of a few more sensors to add to the interior of the mailbox. The Phi Pledge Class will order more sensors and add those in during the upcoming weeks.</p>
